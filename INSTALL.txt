2) Install NumPy package for python:

	Use the automated installer in 'thermochron_install'. If this is not available go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/ and download the 1.6.0 version. 

3) Install the SciPy package for python:

	Use the automated installer in 'thermochron_install'. If this is not available go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/ and download the 0.9.0 version. 

4) Install the Matplotlib package for python:

	Use the automated installer in 'thermochron_install'. If this is not available go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/ and download the 1.0.1 version. 

5) Install MinGW:

	Use the automated installer in 'thermochron_install'. If this is not available go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files and download the installer.  

	In the automated installer there will be a page titled 'Select Components'. Ensure that the following components are selected: MinGW Compiler Suite, C++ Compiler, Fortran Compiler, 
	and MinGW Developer ToolKit. 

6) Install PyMC:

	Unpack the zip file in 'Thermochron install' to a directory of your choice. This zip file is available under downloads at https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymc/

	DO NOT DOWNLOAD VIA EXEC...use full zipped download from github and run like below:

Important: open the following python module: ../pymc/PyMCObjects.py
	(To open a python module right click and select 'open with IDLE')
	Change line 824 of this module to: return -np.inf

	Right click on 'My Computer' and select system properties. Go to Advanced and select Environment Variables. Create a new User Variable named 'PATH' with value
	'C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts'. Also create a User Variable named 'PYTHONPATH' and set its value to the location of PyMC. 

	Open a MinGW shell and change the directory to the location of PyMC. To change directory use 'cd'. Example: 'cd /c/Documents\ and\ Settings/uniquename/My\ Documents/pymc'
	(A forward slash ' \ ' is required before every space)

	Once you are in the correct directory for pymc, type 'python setup.py install' PyMC will begin to install--it will take a few minutes to finish.

	NO: -or- python setup.py build --force -c mingw32 
             python setup.py install --force --skip-build 

         C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.1\Lib\site-packages\pymc

 
7) USe MinGW to run the program. Follow the instructions in the README.txt and in 'model_setup.py'

MAC:

1) Remove older versions of python. Install Enthought Python Distribution:

	EPD provides all of the necessary dependancies: NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Use the installer in the .dmg file in 'thermochron_install'. If this is not available, download the free
	academic version of EPD at: http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php

2) Install PyMC:
